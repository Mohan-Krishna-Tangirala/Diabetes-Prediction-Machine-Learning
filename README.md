# Diabetes Prediction 

## Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning system that predicts whether a person has diabetes based on various medical parameters. 
We will utilize the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, a powerful supervised learning technique, to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic.

## Libraries Used

- NumPy: For numerical operations and array manipulations.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning in predicting diabetes using the Support Vector Machine algorithm. 
The model can effectively classify individuals based on their medical parameters, providing a valuable tool for early detection of diabetes.
